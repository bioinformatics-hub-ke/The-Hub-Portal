# The-Hub-Portal 

**Mission** 

To build a platform to connect science clubs in Kenyan universities to collaborate, learn and allow easy access to local data

**Vision**

I'm working with science clubs in universities to create a platform that brings together young scientists from different parts of Kenya and gives them tools, resources and mentor ship so that they can access local data easily and create solutions that work for our country.

**Motivation**

Universities are usually where young adults get to know what they are interested in. And being a place where people from various parts of the country with similar or different interests can meet and interact, it makes sense to create clubs or groups where they can share ideas, which is what happens in our institutions. When a group of people come together to accomplish a common goal, results can be phenomenal. 
Kenya has a large number of universities which accommodate science students from not only Kenya, but also Eastern Africa and other parts of Africa and the world. The science community is growing and there is need to connect these small communities to build one large one. With a large community, experiences and knowledge can be shared. The BHKi has proven that it is possible to bring together different students from all over. Reaching out to smaller established communities can be more efficient. 
Science groups in universities usually take part in activities such as:
<ul>
<li>yearly scientific workshops. </li>
<li>Peer review academic sessions.</li>
<li>Share academic journals/documentation</li>
<li>Mentor ship sessions from Alumni and Mentors.</li>
<li>Organizing for industry based academic trips to research institutions.</li>
</ul>

However, these clubs or groups usually lack resources to be able to meet all their goals or aims. Having all these clubs in a central place and a platform that holds what they need to accomplish their goals would make their work easier. 

<h1> The Hub Portal </h1>
The Hub Portal is an extension of the BHKi network. It is a platform to connect science clubs in Kenyan universities to collaborate, learn and allow easy access to local data. It will allow students to put in requests for training or mentor ship, find out what other life science and bioinformatics students are doing in other universities and also reach out for collaborations.
